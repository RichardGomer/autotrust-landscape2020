    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has huge potential to improve the efficiency, resilience and accessibility of the UK’s transportation system. By weaving real-time communication and data sharing into vehicles and transport infrastructure, networks could respond to demand, new services could emerge, and advances in “autonomous” self-driving vehicles could be leveraged to build more convenient public transport systems.</p>
    <p>The IoV will be a complex large-scale system with the potential to have far-reaching social, environmental and economic impacts, and so it raises questions of politics, fairness and conflict, just like any other transformation in the way that we organise important aspects of society.</p>
    <p>The IoV’s potential for surveillance raises familiar questions about the balance between security and privacy. Its ability to change how we pay for our use of roads raises familiar questions about equity, fairness and access. There are questions about who will shape the technology, in whose interests they will shape it, and how the IoV might further some people's objectives at the expense of others.</p>
    <p>There are good reasons to spend time considering all those issues now. Considering a full and diverse range of questions and stakeholders is one way to help avoid unintended negative consequences, and to help design an IoV that is acceptable and useful to a wide range of people. Public acceptance of the IoV – like any new technology – will be crucial to adoption and hence to the realisation of its potential benefits.</p>
    <p>The AutoTrust platform &mdash; a reseach platform funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council &mdash; aims to understand these important issues, and to help design a "human-cented" IoV. In this report, we've set out some of the stakeholders in the Internet of Vehicles, their concerns and motivations, and present a series of vignettes that capture a range of different possibilities for the IoV.</p>
    <p>We'll use this report &mdash; and the feedback we get from readers like you &mdash; to shape our own research agenda, and to help others understand the emerging Landscape of the IoV.</p>
    <ol class="questions">
        <li>Throughout the report, you'll see yellow boxes like this one. They contain questions that we'd like your help to answer!

    <h2>A Human-Centred Landscape</h2>
    <p>This report is deliberately non-prescriptive. Rather than set out a particular journey, or a road map to follow, our aim is to prompt discussion and reflection on what a individuals and society want to get from the IoV, and to facilitate onward research into the issues that emerge. We refer to our aspiration for an IoV that's centred on human goals and needs as "human-centred". We've identified three concepts that we think are essential components of human centredness: Usability, Inclusiveness and Agency.</p>

    <p class="term"><strong>Usability</strong> Usability is <span class="quote">"the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use"</span> (ISO 9241-11). Usability requires us to focus on the goals of the people who are using a system, as well as factors such as human psychology, learning and physical capabilities.</p>

    <p class="term"><strong>Inclusiveness</strong> Inclusiveness is the practice of including people, especially those who might otherwise be excluded. Inclusiveness can refer to a design process itself, or to the systems and processes that result. Inclusiveness includes concepts such as accessibility.</p>

    <p class="term"><strong>Agency</strong> Agency is the capacity of an actor (an individual, or group) to act in an environment. People's agency can be limited by systems that have poor usability or which are not inclusive, but also by social, cultural and economic constraints. Design should ensure that people have appropriate agency; for example that a passenger is able to choose where and how they travel, but that a malicious person is not able to interfere with the safe operation of a vehicle.</p>

    <ol class="questions">
        <li>Are there any other concepts that researchers and practitioners must take account of in order to justifiably claim they they are taking a 'human-centred' approach?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>IoV Stakeholders</h2>
    <section id="stakeholders_intro">
        <p>Transportation touches almost every aspect of our lives, and so the stakeholders are numerous. In this section, we aim to provide a description of the important stakeholders that need to be included in the design of the IoV.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="people">
        <h3>People</h3>
        <p>Everybody is a stakeholder in the IoV in their capacity as a private individual, so describing all the different stakeholder groups that might be described as "people" is intractable. However, taking a human-centric approach to designing the IoV does require us to grapple with the richness and diversity of "everybody", and to begin breaking the population down into manageable and coherent parts. In this section, we've started to describe the characteristics of people who'll use the IoV, and the different roles that people might play.</p>

        <p class="term"><strong>Characteristics</strong> Features or qualities belonging to a person.</p>

        <p class="term"><strong>Roles</strong> Functions assumed by people in a particular situation.</p>

        <ol class="questions">
            <li>Are there any other characteristics that are important to consider when designing the IoV?</li>
            <li>Are there any other roles that people will play within the IoV?</li>
        </ol>

        <section id="people_chars">
            <h4>Characteristics</h4>
            <p><strong>Age</strong> Prior research shows that age impacts on people's transport use, and is therefore a factor to consider when designing transport systems (Hoedemaker et al, 2013). Age also impacts upon acceptability, with indications that "feeling safe" is a greater concern for older people (Frison et al, 2018).</p>
            <p><strong>Income</strong> There are practical and conceptual links between poverty and transport, in particular <em>access</em> to transport. Transport provides a means of reaching employment and education, and so improving access to transport can help to address poverty (Titheridge et al, 2014).</p>
            <p><strong>Disabilities</strong> Various disabilities can impact upon how, and whether, people use transport (Rodger et al, 2016). Disabled transport users may have specific information needs (such as knowing where step-free access is available).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="people_roles">
            <h4>Roles</h4>
            <p><strong>Driver</strong> A person who operates a vehicle on a moment-by-moment basis.</p>
            <p><strong>Passenger</strong> A person who is onboard, or intends to board, a vehicle; but not to operate that vehicle on a momebt-by-moment basis. A passenger may have some operational control over a vehicle, for instance by hailing it or specifying a destination.</p>
            <p><strong>Fallback-Ready User</strong> In autonomous vehicles, a fallback-ready user is a passenger within the vehicle who can assume moment-by-moment control of the vehicle should it be required.</p>
            <p><strong>Dispatcher</strong> A dispatcher is a person who operates a vehicle but not on a moment-by-moment basis, for instance by planning a journey and starting/stopping it. Dispatchers may be passengers, or remote.</p>
            <p><strong>Mechanic/Technician</strong> Vehicles require proactive and reactive maintenance, which is usually performed or overseen by a person. The IoV potentially changes how maintenance is carried out.</p>
            <p><strong>Pedestrian</strong> Vehicles and pedestrians often need to interact, for instance in order to communicate intent. It's also common for a journey to combine transport methods, including walking, and so pedestrians may have information needs that relate to other transport modalities.</p>

        <p class="rq">Undertake qualitative research to create a set of transport-user personas that can inform human-centred IoV design.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="institutions">
        <h3>Government &amp; Institutions</h2>
        <p>Governments and (non-commercial) Institutions are important stakeholders. They have strategic and operational roles within the transport system, and often serve - at least ostensibly - to represent the interests of society as a whole. There is already an established network of non-commercial institutions that govern transportation, and it's possible that more will be required and/or emerge as the IoV develops.</p>

        <p>For the organisation stakeholders we've identified, we're interested in understanding their motives (reasons for operating), activities (what they do), means of influence (how they might influence how the IoV develops), and any specific needs that they have.</p>

    <h2>IoV Architecture</h2>

    <p>The broad design principles that underlie the IoV will shape how it develops and how vehicles (and their passengers) relate to the rest of the transport system. In conversations, the biggest architectural questions have been the relative “intelligence” of vehicles versus infrastructure, and the homogeneity of the infrastructure. We've used those two axes to discuss how different architectural decisions might shape the IoV and change its affordances for different stakeholders.</p>


    <!--<img src="infra-quads.svg" style="width: 500px" alt="We use two axes to categorise architecture designs into four quadrants" />-->

    <section id="arch_infra">
        <h3>Homogeneous or Heterogenous Infrastructure?</h3>

        <p>Infrastructure is a broad term; and in the case of the IoV potentially encompasses the infrastructures that we associate with communication (e.g. mobile telecomms,
        and the internet infrastructure more generally), computation (e.g. cloud infrastructure, data feeds and APIs), and highways (such as notification of road closures,
        traffic signals, and signage).</p>

        <section id="infra_list">
            <p>Some of the infrastructures in the IoV might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigation &amp; Route Finding</li>
                <li>Energy Supply &amp; Management</li>
                <li>Traffic Flow Management &amp; Information</li>
                <li>Networking/Telecomms</li>
                <li>Over-the-Top Consumer Services, such as in-vehicle entertainment</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <p>At present, all drivers and vehicles make use of broadly the same transport infrastructure - the same roads, signage and support facilities such as service stations. In future, as a substantial information layer is added to vehicles, there is scope for different vehicles to have radically different support infrastructures in place.</p>

        <p>For example, vehicles needn't all use the same cloud services to provide realtime congestion data or journey planning services. Over time, we imagine that competing infrastructures could emerge - perhaps to serve vehicles made by specific manufacturers. Of course, it's also possible that governments will recognise potential advantages of having a more tightly controlled infrastructure and insist that all vehicles and infrastures follow certain standards, or even deploy a single public infrastructure that all vehicles are required to use.</p>

        <p>The degree of variety within a particular infrastructure could have marked implications for different stakeholders, and for the range of services and features that evolve within the IoV. It's important to bear in mind that different infrastructures could be implemented in different ways. For instance, a government might mandate a single public infrastrcture for automated communication with the emergency services, while journey planning is implemented using manufacturer-specific services.</p>

        <p>Homogeneous or hetergeneous infrastructures have different affordances for stakeholders.</p>

        <section class="comparison">
        <div>
            <h4>Homogeneous Infrastructure</h4>
            <ul id="infra_homo_features">
                <li>A single standardised infrastructure exists for a given purpose, utilised by all vehicles.</li>
                <li>Interoperability is based on published standards. Countries or blocs may develop their own standards akin to the development of national telephone or broadcast standards in the 20th century.</li>
                <li>Infrastructure provides a set of common services and all manufacturers work to a common set of standards, although not all vehicles would necessarily make use of the full range of infrastructure capabilities that are available.</li>
                <li>If the homogeneity is intended, then regulation may be required to limit the emergence of competing infrastructures and fragmentation of the centralised model.</li>
                <li>High scope for mass co-ordination of vehicles, for instance to re-configure key traffic flows in response to incidents, owing to the existence of a centralised control point.</li>
                <li>Vehicle capabilities may be limited by what the infrastructure supports, and hence manufacturers have less scope to innovate in services and features.</li>

        <h3>Smart Vehicles or Smart Infrastructure?</h3>
        <p>The relative balance between on- and off-vehicle processing is an important architectural consideration. The internet itself largely follows a 'dumb network' model, where processing is performed on nodes rather than within the network infrastructure itself. At an application level, though, web services are often highly centralised both in terms of their business models and engineering. It's possible to imagine a future where the IoV just facilitates communication between largely independent vehicles, or - conversely - one in which vehicles are highly dependent on infrastructures that can do computation on their behalf.</p>

    right not to be subject to wholly automated decision making. In autonomous vehicle design, the role of humans and automated features working together is reflected in
    SAE International's "levels of driving automation".</p>

    <p>Intuitively, it feels right that people should be involved - to some degree - in processes that shape their lives; but how can we apply that idea to the IoV?
        How can we make sense of all the different systems and the complexity that could be involved? As a starting point, we've identified a series of different
    "loops" - each associated with a specific aspect of the IoV. A loop is a group of related tasks that will combine human and automated agency in the near future. Each
    loop is what Paul Leonardi terms an "imbrication" &mdash; a mixture of human and automated agency that are established in response to needs and opportunities.</p>

    <p>We’ve aimed to identify the essential characteristics of each loop, and important issues, stakeholders and technologies within each.</p>

    <ol class="questions">
      <li>Are these loops important, and are the descriptions detailed enough to understand what they mean?</li>
      <li>Are these loops likely to involve a significant amount of automation?</li>
      <li>Are there other significant loops that should be added, or should any of these loops be broken down further?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Task Loop</h3>
    <p>The Task loop defines and shapes the task that’s being carried out.
      For example, the task loop might plan when and where to purchase groceries; or decide whether to "grab some odds and ends" from the corner shop or do a "big shop" at the hypermarket.
      This loop is still mostly a human task in 2020, but imbrication with technology could change that in the future.
      For instance, technology in the task loop might identify the need to carry out specific tasks, or opportunistically suggest how routine tasks could be incorporated into a schedule or journey.
      Subtler influences on a person’s tasks, such as advertising or promoting particular destinations, are also included in this loop.</p>

    <p class="example"></p>

    <h3>Journey Loop</h3>
    <p>The journey loop plans and executes aspects of a journey in support of identified tasks.
        It might need to choose a transport mode, identify a route, plan modal interchanges or purchase tickets.
        In 2020 we’re used to using satellite navigation to plan a car journey for us, or using journey planners to suggest public transport routes to a destination.</p>


    <h3>Operating Loop</h3>
    <p>The operating loop controls a vehicle.
        The operating loop is relatively well defined, and models like SAE International's "levels of driving automation" show how different combinations of human and automation agency might work.
        Interaction challenges here are about co-ordinating human and automated control in a safe way, potentially while travelling at speed!</p>


    <h3>Co-Ordination Loop</h3>
    <p>The co-ordination loop is concerned with how a vehicle or journey is co-ordinated with other people or vehicles.
        Co-ordination at a journey level could be as simple as car sharing, but could also include demand-responsive public transport systems or congestion-control mechanisms like spreading load across a transport network.
    <p>At an operational level, co-ordination could control vehicle behaviours like platooning or giving priority to emergency service vehicles.</p>
    <p>Interaction challenges here might involve fairness, the need to respect individual preferences, and how to balance the needs of individual transiteers against those of the wider community.
        In whose interests is my journey being co-ordinated?</p>


    <h3>Maintenance Loop</h3>
    <p>Maintenance is an important part of owning or operating a vehicle or transport system.
        This loop maintains the vehicle by planning and undertaking scheduled or emergency maintenance tasks like checking the tyres, changing engine oil,
        greasing a chain, or installing a software update.</p>


    <h3>Admin Loop</h3>
    <p>There are administrative tasks associated with transport.
        Vehicle owners and operators need to buy insurance, pay taxes, pay tolls for using certain roads, and arrange for safety or operating licenses.
        Public transport users need to purchase tickets and might need to maintain membership of discount or frequent-traveller schemes.</p>
    <p>Some of these tasks – like purchasing insurance, or transport tickets – could be changed by the introduction of automation.</p>


    <h3>Footprint Loop</h3>
    <p>Finally, what we call the “Footprint Loop” involves management of the digital exhaust of connected transport systems; the data traces that our journeys leave behind.
    <p>Those digital traces will often be personal data – linked back to individuals – and potentially allow detailed information about individuals to be gleaned.
        Digital traces will also have valuable and legitimate uses such as informing transport policy, helping operators to deliver efficient public transport services,
        or personalising services so that they meet individual needs.</p>
    <p>Data subjects have certain rights to manage the data that’s collected about them, though; perhaps infrequently, or perhaps actively and deliberately.
        Interaction challenges in this loop include helping individuals to make decisions about data sharing and data logging in advance,
        helping individuals understand how their data is being used and what risks that might entail for them,
        and helping trustworthy data users to build trust in their services with users who might be reluctant to share data that they don’t understand.</p>

<section id="scenarios">

    <h2>Landscape Vignettes</h2>

    <p>Scenarios are one technique that can help to explore possible futures and the design decisions that need to be made about how humans and the IoV interact. We've produced a series of scenarios that help explore the agency of different stakeholders in the IoV. In each scenario, we provide several possible design and engineering possibilities, which balance the agency of different stakeholders in different ways.</p>
    <p>These scenarios illustrate the need to consider agency in general, but also provide an opportunity to identify where stakeholder needs or interests are aligned or in conflict.</p>
    <ol class="questions">
      <li>Are these scenarios plausible?</li>
      <li>Are the different stakeholders fairly represented?</li>
      <li>Are there others ways that the needs of different stakeholders and interests could be satisfied, aligned, or balanced?</li>
   </ol>
</p>

    <p>We have identified some aspects of each scenario that are of particular interest to the AutoTrust project:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="intx-point"></span> where an end-user of some kind needs to interact with an ACV</li>
        <li><span class="inf-point"></span> where an end-user of some kind has a specific information need, or where another stakeholder has a need to provide information to an end-user</li>
        <li><span class="auto-point"></span> where advanced automation, e.g. via preference-elicitation and agents, could be used</li>
        <li><span class="vuln-point"></span> where the vulnerability of a system to malicious influence is an important aspect to be considered</li>
    </ul>

    <section id="scen_pandemic">
        <h3>Pandemic</h3>
        <p>COVID-19 has shown the need for severe restrictions on travel and association in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The UK government has introduced restrictions on non-essential travel, which are enforced by the police, and has been investigating the use of mobile phone data to understand movement patterns. Various projects have proposed technology to help automate contract-tracing.</p>
        <p>In this scenario, we imagine how the IoV might be used by different stakeholders during a similar pandemic event, with restrictions on movement.</p>

        <ul class="stakeholders">
            <li><strong>Government</strong> Motivated, in this case, primarily by concern for public health and the necessity to prevent the spread of a virus, while still allowing some important functions to take place. A mix of central government, and executive agencies such as Public Health England.
            <li><strong>Police</strong> Tasked with enforcing guidance, as well as a general responsibility to public safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Individuals</strong> Who may wish to travel for various reasons, some reasonably described as essential and others not.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The IoV will afford greater surveillance and control opportunities to the authorities. Possible actions available to authorities might include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Collection of journey data to understand population  movements and trends;</li>
            <li>Analysis of specific, non-aggregated journey data to identify individuals who are breaching (or potentially breaching) restrictions;</li>
            <li>Enforcing automated restrictions on journey length or allowed destinations. <span class="auto-point"></span></li>
        </ol>

        <ol class="questions">
            <li>Which actions are acceptable for the authorities to take in this scenario?</li>
            <li>What other actions might be available to the authorities, using the IoV, in this scenario?</li>
            <li>What controls (institutions, regulations, technical measures) might constrain the authorities’ actions in this scenario?</li>
        </ol>

    <section id="scen_aqma_routing">
        <h3>Dynamic Routing for Air Quality</h3>

        <p>In these scenarios, a commuter is using an Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD) service to get to work. While en-route, a series of events occur that could result in the journey being re-routed. In this scenario, a decision is taken by the AMoD service itself or authorities. However, the designers and operators of the service, and the authorities, have different options available to them.</p>

        <ul class="stakeholders">
            <li><strong>Passenger</strong> Aims to get to work on time.</li>
            <li><strong>AMoD Operator</strong> Operates the AMoD service , and makes decisions about how it will operate.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Authority</strong> Is responsible for highways, and air quality within a designated Air Quality Management Area (AQMA).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Congestion is detected en-route; other routes are less congested and are likely to be faster overall. The vehicle may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>choose an alternative faster route</li>
            <li>remain on the current route, despite the congestion</li>
            <li>ask the passenger what to do <span class="intx-point"></span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Routes are all busy, but there's no unusual congestion. An air quality management area (AQMA) is close to exceeding the limit on PM<sub>25</sub> particulate pollution.
            An alternative route is available, which takes an additional ten minutes and will make the passenger late for work.</p>

        <p>The local authority could issue a mandatory directive that petrol vehicles must avoid the area; the vehicle must take the alternative route. The vehicle may respond by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Informing the passenger of the change, and the reasons for it. <span class="info-point"></span></li>
            <li>Not informing the passenger of the change, but updating the predicted arrival time to account for the detour.</li>
            <li>Not informing the passenger of the change and gradually adjusting the estimated arrival time to conceal the route change.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Or, the local authority could offer an incentive to vehicles to avoid the area. The vehicle may respond by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asking the passenger whether to continue on the original route, or accept a discount on their journey in return for taking the longer detour; <span class="intx-point"></span></li>
            <li>Consulting a set of stored passenger preferences and acting on a recorded preference to (e.g.) avoid AQMAs that are nearing or exceeding
                pollution limits. <span class="auto-point"></span></p>
            <li>Ignoring the incentive and carrying on via the original route.</li>
            <li>Taking the longer detour, but not informing the passenger and keeping the incentive for the AMoD operator.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol class="questions">
            <li>Which responses are acceptable and preferable in this scenario?</li>
            <li>What other actions might be available to the local authority, passenger, or vehicle operator in this scenario?</li>
            <li>What controls (institutions, regulations, technical measures) might constrain unacceptable actions in this scenario?</li>

        <h3>IoV in the Nighttime Economy</h3>
        <p>Various patrons of late-night establishments rely on a mixed transport infrastructure to get home after their nights out.</p>

        <p>One patron seeks to operate their private vehicle in non-automated mode. The vehicle is fitted with an “alcolock” device, which
            requires a breath sample before granting them control of the vehicle. The vehicle detects that the person is 90% likely to exceed the
            legal drink drive limit. The vehicle might:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fall back to a completely automated mode, prompting for a destination and then operating automatically. <span class="intx-point"></span></li>
            <li>Opt not to operate at all, in case even a fully automated journey might require manual driver intervention at some point. <span class="inf-point"></span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>A second patron is attempting to get home. Although not significantly intoxicated today, they once vomited in an AMoD vehicle, an event which is recorded
            against their account. The AMoD operator might:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deny travel to the patron for what’s perceived to be a “high risk” journey (based on time and location). <span class="inf-point"></span></li>
            <li>Allow travel as normal.</li>
            <li>Allow travel, but at a higher price. <span class="info-point"></span></li>
            <li>Allow travel, with a security deposit blocked on the patron’s credit card in advance. <span class="intx-point"></span></li>
        </ul>

        <ol class="questions">
            <li>In these scenarios, which responses are acceptable and preferable?</li>
            <li>What other responses are available to an automated vehicle or AMoD service?</li>

        <h3>Vehicle Security Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>A connected vehicle is designed, approved, manufactured and sold to consumers.</p>
        <p>Eighteen months after release, a software defect is detected that allows a remote malicious user to issue commands to the vehicle
        control unit by sending specially crafted packets to the vehicle through its 5G connection. Unauthorised commands could have significant safety
        implications.</p>
        <p>A software update is available to correct the effect, and a security advisory has been published to notify the public. Various actors need to decide how
        to respond.</p>
        <p>The vehicle manufacturer could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Install the update automatically while the vehicle is not in use.</li>
            <li>Inform the keeper of the vehicle that the update is available, and let them choose if and when to install it. <span class="inf-point"></span> </li>
        </ul>

        <p>An insurance company could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not take software updates into account, and continue to insure the vehicle.</li>
            <li>Require, via policy terms, that the vehicle is kept up to date with software updates in order to qualify for cover.</li>
            <li>Verify, by communicating with the vehicle, whether it is up to date, and remotely block the engine from being started until it is patched. <span class="auto-point"></span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>A regulatory body could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Withdraw approval from affected vehicles, until they are patched, rendering them illegal to operate on a public highway. <span class="inf-point"></span> </li>
            <li>Write to registered keepers to notify them of the flaw, but allow vehicles to be used. <span class="vuln-point"></span></li>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>Building a sustainable human-centred Internet of Vehicles requires designers, engineers, operators, and policymakers
        to confront difficult questions about agency, inclusiveness, and usability, and how those aspects are embedded into the
